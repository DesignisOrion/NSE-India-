### Overview:

"Company A" needs to see a previous .csv file. The company owner decided to retire and wanted to still have access to the stock market data. He is only intrested in the "63MOONS" stock for he feels it will be a great ROI in time. No questions, we only answer to the boss (lol). In this project I will deliver the owner the data needed for him to  review. Let's hope he's pleased.
